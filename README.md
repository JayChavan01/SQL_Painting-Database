# Painting-Database

### Overview:
This project is an SQL-based case study in which I solve various queries related to a painting database using MySQL. The queries focus on retrieving insights about paintings, museums, artists, and sales trends. The project does not use Excel or Power BIâ€”only SQL is used to process and analyze the data.
